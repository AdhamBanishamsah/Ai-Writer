# Privacy Policy — Ai Writer

**Last updated:** February 2025

Ai Writer ("the extension") is a Chrome extension that helps you rewrite and improve text using AI. This policy describes how the extension handles your data.

## Data we do not collect

- The extension does **not** collect your browsing history, personal data, or usage analytics.
- The extension does **not** sell or share any data with third parties.

## Data stored on your device

The extension stores the following **only on your device** using Chrome’s storage API:

- **API configuration** — Your AI provider choice (OpenAI or Google Gemini), API key, endpoint URL, and model name. This is stored locally in your browser and is **not** sent to us or any server we control.

## Data sent to third parties

- **When you use “Rewrite”** — The text you select and the rewrite mode you choose are sent **only** to the AI provider you configured (OpenAI or Google Gemini), using **your** API key. That request is between your browser and the provider’s API; we do not see or store that text.
- **Provider policies** — Use of OpenAI or Google Gemini is subject to their respective privacy and terms of service. We do not control how they process the text you send.

## Permissions

- **Storage** — To save your API settings locally.
- **activeTab / scripting / &lt;all_urls&gt;** — To read the text you select and, when you choose “Replace,” to insert the rewritten text into the page. We do not collect or log page content.
- **contextMenus** — To show “Rewrite”, “Fix grammar”, etc. in the right‑click menu when you select text.
- **notifications** — Only to show a short “Result copied to clipboard” message when the result cannot be shown in the page.

## Changes

We may update this policy occasionally. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised when we do.
